        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am an accountant seeking to dive into programing to develop my own accounting software to use with my accounting clients. I believe that accounting software today is too dependent on the user having a solid understanding of accounting as well as of the software they are using. In my experience, users usually lack one or both of those things. I aim to create an intuitive accounting software to sync with QuickBook Online to largely eliminate the need for a basic bookkeeper.</p>
